In fact, Russia is a whole universe with the gentle sea of the south, the dense forests of the Sayan Mountains and the harsh ice of the Putorana plateau. And you can also see all these beauties without millions on your account, a passport and many hours of flights. Like, for example, Vera Bashmakova — a brave young mother who took three children in her arms, sat them in her Lada and drove 20 thousand kilometers across her native country. We have selected and described some interesting places worthy of your vacation.",
